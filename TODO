. pypusworkspace.py or workspace.pypus - file proliferation, easy to delivery
	- $PYPUS_PATH can control proliferation and it's good idea to use functions from other projects
. $PYPUS_HOME - no proliferation, hard to delivery

we can have both approaches:
. atomic workspace to handle specific project functions
. $PYPUS_HOME to act as a commom area from functions shared among projects

. local pypusrc?
	- variables can be defined into workspace
	- workspace is python file
	- pypusrc is a python file
